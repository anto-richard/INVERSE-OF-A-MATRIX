# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX:

## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix.

## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs.
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner.

## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
Import numpy as np to find the inverse of a matrix.
### Step 2:
Get the input from the user as A to find the inverse of a matrix.
### Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.inv(A),the inverse of a matrix is found.
### Step 4: 
Print the values and End the Program.

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: Anto Richard.S
#RegisterNumber: 21001221
import numpy as np
A=([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(b)
```
## Output:
![inverse](inv.png)

## Result:
Thus, the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program.
